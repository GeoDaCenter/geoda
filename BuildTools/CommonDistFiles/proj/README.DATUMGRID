# PROJ-DATUMGRID

The files in this package can be unpacked in the PROJ data directory.
For an installed PROJ this may be /usr/local/share/proj or /usr/share/proj
on unix style operating systems.

Note that this package includes "CTable2" format grid shift files for
NAD27 in the USA and require PROJ 4.8.0 or newer.  On the plus side there
is no need to compile ascii files into binary files with this version as
CTable2 files are not system dependent (as distinct from the CTable files
produced in PROJ 4.7.0 and older).

## About the Datum Grid package

The datum grid package for PROJ is maintained on the OSGeo proj-datumgrid
repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid).
All grids in the package are released under
permissive licenses. New grids are accepted into the package as long as
they are released under a license that is compatible with the [Open Source
Definition](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated) and the source of the grid
is clearly stated and verifiable. Suitable licenses include:

  * Public domain
  * X/MIT
  * BSD 2/3/4 clause
  * CC0
  * CC-BY (v3.0 or later)
  * CC-BY-SA (v3.0 or later)

# Regional PROJ resource packages

In addition to the core proj-datumgrid package, regional collections of grids
and init-files also exist. These includes grids and init-files that are not
essential for the functionality of PROJ but still of general interest to
PROJ-users in the package-specific regions.

The regional packages can be downloaded from the
[OSGeo download server](http://download.osgeo.org/proj/).

### Europe

The regional package for Europe includes resources for the following
countries:

* Denmark
* Ireland+Northern Ireland
* The Faroe Islands
* The Nordic+Baltic countries

More information about the included grids and init files can be found in
[README.EUROPE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/master/europe/README.EUROPE)

### North America

The regional package for North America includes resources for the following
countries:
