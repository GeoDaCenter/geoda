# A client registers THIS as a command:

#   codex  mcp add geoda -- ~/.geoda/bin/geoda-mcp
#
# Registering the app's HTTP endpoint by URL instead — `url = http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`
# — leaves a URL in the model's context, and a model that cannot see the server's
# tools (a client that was not restarted after registering, or that started while
# the app was down) will drive that endpoint by hand: hand-written JSON-RPC
# envelopes, headers and temp files, tens of calls per session. As a command the
# client starts this process and the model only ever sees tools.
#
# The script is a pass-through, and deliberately thin: one newline-delimited
# JSON-RPC message in on stdin, one POST to the app's loopback endpoint, one JSON
# reply out on stdout. Nothing else may go to stdout — it is the frame stream.
#
# Usage: geoda-mcp
#
# The app must be running. `~/.geoda/mcp.json`, which the app writes when its
# MCP server starts, carries the port that was actually bound (8765, or the next
# free port up to 8774, or an OS-assigned one); the pinned default below is only
